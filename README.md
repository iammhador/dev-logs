# 📚 Dev Logs

Welcome to **Dev Logs**, an open-source learning repository — a structured, version-controlled journey into mastering full-stack and foundational development topics, one branch at a time.

---

## 🎯 Vision

This open-source repository is a **central hub for comprehensive learning paths**, organized by separate branches for each major topic (JavaScript, React, SQL, etc.).  
It's designed to:

- Provide deep understanding of modern development tools and concepts
- Reinforce interview-ready knowledge
- Serve as a reference for developers at all levels
- Showcase structured learning and development best practices
- Offer multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF) for different learning preferences
