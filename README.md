# 🌿 branch-out-learning

Welcome to **branch-out-learning**, my personal learning lab — a structured, version-controlled journey into mastering full-stack and foundational development topics, one branch at a time.

---

## 🎯 Vision

This repository is a **central hub for all my self-learning paths**, organized by separate branches for each major topic (JavaScript, React, SQL, etc.).  
It’s designed to:

- Deepen my core understanding of modern development tools and concepts
- Reinforce interview-ready knowledge
- Serve as a reference I can revisit and build on
- Showcase consistent growth and dedication to craftsmanship

## 📚 Learning Style

Each branch is structured to be:

- Beginner-friendly but deep enough for advanced learners
- Based on **real-world use cases + interview prep**
- Filled with **examples, mini projects, and visual explanations**
- Self-contained, so you can clone just that branch and start learning

---

## 📖 Current Focus: `js` Branch

In the `js` branch, you’ll find:

### ✅ Chapters Covered:

1. Variables, Types & Operators
2. Functions, Scope & Hoisting
3. Closures, `this` keyword, and Callbacks
4. Objects, Classes, Prototypes
5. Promises, Async/Await, and Event Loop
6. Advanced Topics: Proxy, Reflect, Generator
7. Interview Problems & Patterns
8. Final Project: **Smart Task Manager (To-do+)**

Each chapter is written in markdown with:

- 📘 Plain English Explanations
- 🧪 Code Examples with Comments
- ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- 💡 Interview Insights
- 🧠 Practice Challenges

---

## 🧩 Final Project Per Track

Every track ends with a **real-world project** built using the knowledge gained in that branch.  
For example, the JavaScript branch ends with:

### 🔨 `Smart Task Manager (To-do+)`

A powerful task app with:

- DOM interactivity
- Drag & drop
- Tags, filters, and local storage
- Bonus: Includes Proxy & Generator usage

---
