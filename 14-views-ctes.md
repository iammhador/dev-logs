# Chapter 14: Views and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

## üìö What You'll Learn

Views and CTEs are powerful tools for creating virtual tables, simplifying complex queries, and organizing data access. Views provide a persistent virtual layer over your data, while CTEs offer temporary, query-scoped virtual tables. This chapter covers creating, managing, and optimizing both for better database design and query organization.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand the differences between views and CTEs
- Create simple and complex views with proper security
- Build recursive and non-recursive CTEs
- Implement updatable views and understand their limitations
- Use views for data abstraction and security
- Optimize view and CTE performance
- Handle view dependencies and maintenance

## üîç Concept Explanation

### What are Views?

Views are virtual tables that don't store data themselves but provide a saved query that can be referenced like a table. They're useful for:
- **Data Abstraction**: Hide complex joins and calculations
- **Security**: Restrict access to specific columns/rows
- **Simplification**: Provide user-friendly interfaces to complex data
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent data access patterns

**Types of Views:**
- **Simple Views**: Based on single table, usually updatable
- **Complex Views**: Multiple tables, aggregations, may not be updatable
- **Materialized Views**: Physically store results (PostgreSQL)
- **Indexed Views**: Materialized with indexes (SQL Server)

### What are CTEs?

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are temporary named result sets that exist only within the scope of a single query. They're excellent for:
- **Query Organization**: Break complex queries into readable parts
- **Recursive Operations**: Tree traversal, hierarchical data
- **Avoiding Repetition**: Reference the same subquery multiple times
- **Readability**: Make complex logic more understandable

**Types of CTEs:**
- **Non-Recursive**: Simple temporary result sets
- **Recursive**: Self-referencing for hierarchical data
- **Multiple CTEs**: Several CTEs in one query

## üëÅÔ∏è Basic Views

### Creating Simple Views

**MySQL:**
```sql
-- Simple customer view with calculated fields
CREATE VIEW customer_summary AS
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    email,
    phone,
    status,
    created_at,
    DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), created_at) AS days_since_registration
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Product catalog view with pricing
CREATE VIEW product_catalog AS
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.sku,
    c.category_name,
    p.price,
    p.stock_quantity,
    CASE 
        WHEN p.stock_quantity = 0 THEN 'Out of Stock'
        WHEN p.stock_quantity < 10 THEN 'Low Stock'
        ELSE 'In Stock'
    END AS stock_status,
    p.created_at
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE p.status = 'active';

-- Order details view with customer info
CREATE VIEW order_details_view AS
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
    c.email AS customer_email,
    o.status,
    o.total_amount,
    COUNT(oi.order_item_id) AS item_count,
    GROUP_CONCAT(p.product_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS products
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.order_date, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email, o.status, o.total_amount;

-- Using views
SELECT * FROM customer_summary WHERE days_since_registration > 365;

SELECT * FROM product_catalog WHERE stock_status = 'Low Stock';

SELECT * FROM order_details_view WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
-- Customer analytics view with window functions
CREATE VIEW customer_analytics AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS full_name,
    c.email,
    c.status,
    c.created_at,
    EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (CURRENT_DATE - c.created_at)) AS days_since_registration,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) AS total_spent,
    COALESCE(AVG(o.total_amount), 0) AS avg_order_value,
    MAX(o.order_date) AS last_order_date,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) DESC) AS spending_rank
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id AND o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email, c.status, c.created_at;

-- Product performance view
CREATE VIEW product_performance AS
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.sku,
    c.category_name,
    p.price,
    p.stock_quantity,

        WHEN COUNT(oi.order_item_id) < 5 THEN 'Low Demand'
        WHEN COUNT(oi.order_item_id) < 20 THEN 'Medium Demand'
        ELSE 'High Demand'
    END AS demand_category
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.sku, c.category_name, p.price, p.stock_quantity;

-- Monthly sales summary view
CREATE VIEW monthly_sales_summary AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) AS unique_customers,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue,

FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### Updatable Views

**MySQL:**
```sql
-- Simple updatable view
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    phone,
    status
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active'
WITH CHECK OPTION;

-- Update through view
UPDATE active_customers 
SET phone = '555-0123' 
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- Insert through view (will enforce WHERE condition due to WITH CHECK OPTION)
INSERT INTO active_customers (first_name, last_name, email, status)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@email.com', 'active');

-- This would fail due to WITH CHECK OPTION
-- INSERT INTO active_customers (first_name, last_name, email, status)
-- VALUES ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane@email.com', 'inactive');

-- View with calculated columns (not updatable)
CREATE VIEW customer_stats AS
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id) AS order_count,
    (SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id) AS total_spent
FROM customers c;

-- This view is not updatable due to subqueries
```

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
-- Updatable view with rules
CREATE VIEW active_products AS
SELECT 
    product_id,
    product_name,
    sku,
    price,
    stock_quantity,
    category_id
FROM products
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Create rules for complex update behavior
CREATE OR REPLACE RULE active_products_update AS
    ON UPDATE TO active_products
    DO INSTEAD
    UPDATE products
    SET 
        product_name = NEW.product_name,
        sku = NEW.sku,
        price = NEW.price,
        stock_quantity = NEW.stock_quantity,
        category_id = NEW.category_id,
        updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE product_id = OLD.product_id
      AND status = 'active';

CREATE OR REPLACE RULE active_products_insert AS
    ON INSERT TO active_products
    DO INSTEAD
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, sku, price, stock_quantity, category_id, status, created_at)
    VALUES (NEW.product_name, NEW.sku, NEW.price, NEW.stock_quantity, NEW.category_id, 'active', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

CREATE OR REPLACE RULE active_products_delete AS
    ON DELETE TO active_products
    DO INSTEAD
    UPDATE products
    SET status = 'inactive', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE product_id = OLD.product_id;

-- Using the updatable view
INSERT INTO active_products (product_name, sku, price, stock_quantity, category_id)
VALUES ('New Product', 'NP001', 29.99, 100, 1);

UPDATE active_products 
SET price = 24.99 
WHERE sku = 'NP001';

-- "Delete" (actually sets status to inactive)
DELETE FROM active_products WHERE sku = 'NP001';
```

## üéØ Use Cases & Interview Tips

### Common Interview Questions:

1. **"What's the difference between views and CTEs?"**
   - Views: Persistent, reusable, can be indexed (materialized)
   - CTEs: Query-scoped, temporary, better for complex query organization
   - Use views for consistent data access, CTEs for query readability

2. **"When would you use a materialized view?"**
   - Expensive aggregations that don't need real-time data
   - Complex joins across large tables
   - Reporting and analytics workloads
   - When query performance is more important than data freshness

3. **"How do you handle view dependencies?"**
   - Document dependencies clearly
   - Use dependency tracking tools
   - Consider impact when modifying base tables
   - Plan migration strategies for schema changes

4. **"What are the limitations of updatable views?"**
   - Must be based on single table (usually)
   - Cannot contain aggregations, DISTINCT, GROUP BY
   - Cannot have calculated columns in UPDATE
   - Complex views may require INSTEAD OF triggers

### Best Practices:

1. **Use descriptive names for views and CTEs**
2. **Document complex view logic thoroughly**
3. **Consider performance implications of nested views**
4. **Use materialized views for expensive operations**
5. **Implement proper security through views**
6. **Test view updates and dependencies**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Watch Out For

### 1. **View Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Problem: Nested views can cause performance issues
CREATE VIEW slow_nested_view AS
SELECT * FROM expensive_view
WHERE some_condition = 'value';

-- Solution: Flatten the query or use materialized views
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW optimized_view AS
SELECT 
    -- Direct query instead of nesting views
    column1, column2, calculated_field
FROM base_table
WHERE conditions
  AND some_condition = 'value';
```

### 2. **CTE Recursion Limits**
```sql
-- Problem: Infinite recursion
WITH RECURSIVE infinite_loop AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM infinite_loop  -- No termination condition!
)
SELECT * FROM infinite_loop;

-- Solution: Add proper termination conditions
WITH RECURSIVE safe_recursion AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n, 0 AS level
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1, level + 1 
    FROM safe_recursion 
    WHERE level < 100  -- Termination condition
)
SELECT * FROM safe_recursion;
```

### 3. **Materialized View Staleness**
```sql
-- Problem: Forgetting to refresh materialized views
-- Data becomes stale and reports are inaccurate

-- Solution: Set up automatic refresh schedules
SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-daily-analytics', '0 2 * * *', 
    'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY daily_analytics;');

-- Or use triggers for critical data
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_customer_stats()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY customer_stats_mv;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER refresh_stats_on_order
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON orders
    FOR EACH STATEMENT
    EXECUTE FUNCTION refresh_customer_stats();
```

### 4. **Security Through Obscurity**
```sql
-- Problem: Relying only on views for security
CREATE VIEW public_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customers;
-- Users can still access the base table!

-- Solution: Combine with proper permissions
REVOKE ALL ON customers FROM public;
GRANT SELECT ON public_customers TO application_role;

-- Or use Row Level Security (PostgreSQL)
ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY customer_access_policy ON customers
    FOR ALL TO application_role
    USING (customer_id = current_setting('app.current_customer_id')::INT);
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll explore **Transactions and Concurrency Control** - essential concepts for maintaining data integrity in multi-user environments. You'll learn about ACID properties, isolation levels, locking mechanisms, and how to handle concurrent access to your database.

---

## üìù Quick Practice

Try these view and CTE exercises:

1. **Business Intelligence Views**: Create a set of views for executive reporting
2. **Security Views**: Implement role-based data access through views
3. **Recursive CTEs**: Build hierarchical data navigation (org charts, categories)
4. **Materialized Views**: Create and maintain analytics tables
5. **Complex CTEs**: Break down complex analytical queries into readable parts

Consider:
- When to use views vs CTEs vs materialized views
- Performance implications of your design choices
- Security and access control requirements
- Maintenance and refresh strategies for materialized views
- Documentation and dependency management
