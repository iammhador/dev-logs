## üìñ Concept Explanation

**Aggregate functions** perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single result. They're essential for data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence. Think of them as "summarizing" your data - turning many rows into meaningful insights.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Input**: Multiple rows
2. **Output**: Single value
3. **NULL Handling**: Most aggregates ignore NULL values
4. **Grouping**: Work with GROUP BY to create subtotals
5. **Filtering**: Use HAVING to filter aggregated results

### Common Aggregate Functions:
- **COUNT()**: Count rows or non-NULL values
- **SUM()**: Add up numeric values
- **AVG()**: Calculate average of numeric values
- **MIN()**: Find minimum value
- **MAX()**: Find maximum value
- **STDDEV()**: Calculate standard deviation
- **VARIANCE()**: Calculate variance

## üî¢ COUNT Function

### COUNT Variations
```sql
COUNT(*)           -- Count all rows (including NULLs)
COUNT(column)      -- Count non-NULL values in column
COUNT(DISTINCT column)  -- Count unique non-NULL values
```

### Basic COUNT Examples

**1. Simple Counting:**
```sql
-- Total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_customers
FROM customers;

-- Customers with phone numbers
SELECT COUNT(phone) as customers_with_phone
FROM customers;

-- Customers with verified emails
SELECT COUNT(*) as verified_customers
FROM customers
WHERE email_verified = true;

-- Unique countries
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) as unique_countries
FROM customers;
```

**2. COUNT with Conditions:**
```sql
-- Count orders by status
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_orders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending_orders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 END) as cancelled_orders,
    
    -- Calculate percentages
    ROUND(
        COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
    ) as completion_rate
FROM orders;

-- Count customers by registration year
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) as registration_year,
    COUNT(*) as new_customers,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN email_verified = true THEN 1 END) as verified_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at)
ORDER BY registration_year;
```

**3. Advanced COUNT Patterns:**
```sql
-- Count distinct customers who made purchases in different time periods
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
        WHEN order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' 
        THEN customer_id 
    END) as active_last_30_days,
    
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
        WHEN order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days' 
        THEN customer_id 
    END) as active_last_90_days,
    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as total_customers_with_orders
FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('completed', 'shipped', 'delivered');

-- Count products by availability and price range
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_products,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN stock_quantity > 0 THEN 1 END) as in_stock_products,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN price < 50 THEN 1 END) as budget_products,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN price BETWEEN 50 AND 200 THEN 1 END) as mid_range_products,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN price > 200 THEN 1 END) as premium_products,
    
    -- Count products with reviews
    COUNT(CASE WHEN average_rating IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as products_with_reviews
FROM products
WHERE status = 'active';
```

## üìà Advanced Aggregate Functions

### Statistical Functions

**1. Standard Deviation and Variance:**
```sql
-- Price distribution analysis
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(p.product_id) as product_count,
    AVG(p.price) as avg_price,
    STDDEV(p.price) as price_stddev,
    VARIANCE(p.price) as price_variance,
    
    -- Coefficient of variation (relative variability)
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(p.price) > 0 
        THEN STDDEV(p.price) / AVG(p.price)
        ELSE NULL
    END as coefficient_of_variation
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
WHERE p.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
HAVING COUNT(p.product_id) >= 5  -- Categories with enough products
ORDER BY coefficient_of_variation DESC;

-- Order value consistency by customer
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    STDDEV(o.total_amount) as order_value_stddev,
    
    -- Customer spending consistency
    CASE 
        WHEN STDDEV(o.total_amount) < AVG(o.total_amount) * 0.3 THEN 'Consistent'
        WHEN STDDEV(o.total_amount) < AVG(o.total_amount) * 0.7 THEN 'Moderate'
        ELSE 'Variable'
    END as spending_pattern
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) >= 5  -- Customers with enough orders
ORDER BY order_value_stddev DESC;
```

**2. Percentiles (PostgreSQL):**
```sql
-- Order value percentiles
SELECT 
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amount) as q1_25th_percentile,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amount) as median_50th_percentile,

    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amount) as p90_90th_percentile,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amount) as p95_95th_percentile
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Customer spending distribution
SELECT 
    customer_segment,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    AVG(total_spent) as avg_spent,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_spent) as median_spent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
        CASE 
            WHEN SUM(o.total_amount) < 100 THEN 'Low Value'
            WHEN SUM(o.total_amount) < 500 THEN 'Medium Value'
            WHEN SUM(o.total_amount) < 2000 THEN 'High Value'
            ELSE 'Premium Value'
        END as customer_segment
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE o.status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY c.customer_id
) customer_spending
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY avg_spent DESC;
```

### String Aggregation

**1. STRING_AGG (PostgreSQL) / GROUP_CONCAT (MySQL):**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Concatenate product names by category
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(p.product_id) as product_count,
    STRING_AGG(p.product_name, ', ' ORDER BY p.product_name) as product_list
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
WHERE p.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
ORDER BY product_count DESC;

-- MySQL: Same functionality with GROUP_CONCAT
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(p.product_id) as product_count,
    GROUP_CONCAT(p.product_name ORDER BY p.product_name SEPARATOR ', ') as product_list
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
WHERE p.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
ORDER BY product_count DESC;

-- Customer order history summary
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
    STRING_AGG(
        o.order_id::text || ' ($' || o.total_amount || ')',
        ', ' 
        ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
    ) as order_history
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) <= 5  -- Customers with few orders
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as running_total,
    
    -- Running average
    AVG(daily_revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date 
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as running_average
FROM (
    SELECT

    c.last_name,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    
    -- Rankings
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC) as spending_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(o.order_id) DESC) as frequency_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(o.total_amount) DESC) as avg_value_rank,

## üéØ Use Cases & Interview Tips

### Common Interview Questions:

1. **"What's the difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column)?"**
   - COUNT(*): Counts all rows, including those with NULL values
   - COUNT(column): Counts only non-NULL values in the specified column
   - COUNT(DISTINCT column): Counts unique non-NULL values

2. **"How do aggregate functions handle NULL values?"**
   - Most aggregates (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) ignore NULL values
   - COUNT(*) includes rows with NULLs, COUNT(column) excludes them
   - If all values are NULL, SUM returns NULL, COUNT returns 0

3. **"When would you use HAVING vs WHERE?"**
   - WHERE: Filters rows before grouping and aggregation
   - HAVING: Filters groups after aggregation
   - HAVING can use aggregate functions, WHERE cannot

### Performance Best Practices:

1. **Index Strategy for Aggregates:**
   ```sql
   -- Create indexes for GROUP BY columns
   CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_product ON order_items(product_id);
   
   -- Covering indexes for common aggregate queries
   CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_date_amount ON orders(status, order_date, total_amount);
   ```

2. **Efficient Aggregate Queries:**
   ```sql
   -- Good: Filter before aggregating
   SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount)
   FROM orders 
   WHERE status = 'completed'  -- Filter first
   GROUP BY customer_id;
   
   -- Avoid: Aggregating then filtering
   SELECT customer_id, total_spent
   FROM (
       SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) as total_spent
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY customer_id
   ) t
   WHERE total_spent > 1000;  -- Better to use HAVING
   ```

3. **Use Appropriate Data Types:**
   ```sql
   -- Use DECIMAL for monetary calculations
   SELECT SUM(price::DECIMAL(10,2)) FROM products;
   
   -- Be careful with integer division
   SELECT AVG(price::FLOAT) FROM products;  -- Avoid integer truncation
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Watch Out For

### 1. **NULL Handling Gotchas**
```sql
-- Problem: Unexpected results with NULLs
SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews;  -- Ignores NULL ratings

-- Solution: Handle NULLs explicitly
SELECT 
    AVG(rating) as avg_rating_excluding_nulls,
    AVG(COALESCE(rating, 0)) as avg_rating_including_nulls_as_zero,
    COUNT(*) as total_reviews,
    COUNT(rating) as reviews_with_rating
FROM reviews;
```

### 2. **Integer Division Issues**
```sql
-- Problem: Integer division truncates
SELECT 5 / 2;  -- Returns 2, not 2.5

-- Solution: Cast to decimal/float
SELECT 5.0 / 2;  -- Returns 2.5
SELECT 5::FLOAT / 2;  -- PostgreSQL
SELECT CAST(5 AS FLOAT) / 2;  -- Standard SQL
```

### 3. **GROUP BY Requirements**
```sql
-- Error: Non-aggregated column not in GROUP BY
SELECT customer_id, order_date, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;  -- order_date must be in GROUP BY or aggregated

-- Correct: Include all non-aggregated columns
SELECT customer_id, order_date, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, order_date;

-- Or aggregate the column
SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date), COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 4. **Performance with Large Datasets**
```sql
-- Slow: Aggregating without proper indexes
SELECT category_id, AVG(price)
FROM products
GROUP BY category_id;  -- Needs index on category_id

-- Fast: With proper index
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category_id);
```

### 5. **Precision Issues with Averages**
```sql
-- Problem: Precision loss
SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;  -- May lose precision

-- Solution: Use appropriate precision
SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2) FROM products;
SELECT AVG(price::DECIMAL(10,2)) FROM products;
```

## üìù Quick Practice

Try these aggregate function exercises:

1. **Basic Aggregates**: Calculate total sales, average order value, and customer count for the last quarter
2. **Conditional Aggregates**: Count orders by status and calculate completion rate
3. **Grouped Aggregates**: Find the top 5 product categories by revenue
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate price distribution (mean, median, standard deviation) by category
5. **Customer Analysis**: Identify customers in the top 10% by spending using percentiles

Consider:
- How do you handle NULL values in your calculations?
- What indexes would improve performance?
- How do you ensure precision in monetary calculations?
- What business insights can you derive from the aggregated data?
