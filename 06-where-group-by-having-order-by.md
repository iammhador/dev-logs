- Grouping data with GROUP BY
- Filtering groups with HAVING
- Sorting results with ORDER BY
- Combining these clauses effectively
- Performance considerations and best practices

## üìñ Concept Explanation

These four clauses are the backbone of data retrieval in SQL. They work together to filter, group, aggregate, and sort your data:

- **WHERE**: Filters individual rows before grouping
- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that share common values
- **HAVING**: Filters groups after aggregation
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the final result set

### SQL Query Execution Order:
```
1. FROM       - Choose tables
2. WHERE      - Filter rows
3. GROUP BY   - Group rows
4. HAVING     - Filter groups
5. SELECT     - Choose columns
6. ORDER BY   - Sort results
7. LIMIT      - Limit results
```

Understanding this order is crucial for writing effective queries!

## üîç WHERE Clause - Filtering Rows

### Basic WHERE Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

### Comparison Operators

**1. Basic Comparisons:**
```sql
-- Equality and inequality
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = 29.99;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price != 29.99;  -- or <>
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 50;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price <= 100;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE stock_quantity >= 10;

-- Date comparisons
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-01-15';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date < '2020-01-01';
```

**2. Range Conditions:**
```sql
-- BETWEEN (inclusive)
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

-- Equivalent to:
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE price >= 10 AND price <= 50;

-- Date ranges
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

-- NOT BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 50;
```

**3. List Conditions:**
```sql
-- IN operator
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category_id IN (1, 3, 5, 7);

SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped');

-- NOT IN
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category_id NOT IN (2, 4, 6);

-- IN with subquery
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category_id IN (
    SELECT category_id 
    FROM categories 
    WHERE category_name LIKE '%Electronics%'
);
```

**4. Pattern Matching:**
```sql
-- LIKE with wildcards
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE first_name LIKE 'John%';     -- Starts with 'John'

SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';    -- Ends with '@gmail.com'

SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE product_name LIKE '%phone%'; -- Contains 'phone'

SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE phone LIKE '555-____';       -- _ matches single character

-- Case-insensitive search (PostgreSQL)
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'john%';

-- Regular expressions (PostgreSQL)
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE email ~ '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$';

-- MySQL regular expressions
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE email REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$';
```

**5. NULL Handling:**
```sql
-- Check for NULL values
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;

-- NULL in comparisons (always returns NULL/false)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE description = NULL;     -- Wrong! Returns no rows
SELECT * FROM products WHERE description IS NULL;    -- Correct!

-- COALESCE for NULL handling
SELECT customer_id, 
       COALESCE(phone, 'No phone') as contact_phone
FROM customers;
```

### Logical Operators

**1. AND, OR, NOT:**
```sql
-- AND: All conditions must be true
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE price > 10 AND price < 100 AND stock_quantity > 0;

-- OR: At least one condition must be true
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'shipped' OR status = 'delivered';

-- NOT: Negates the condition
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE NOT (first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe');

-- Complex combinations with parentheses
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE (category_id = 1 OR category_id = 2) 
  AND price > 50 
  AND stock_quantity > 0;
```

**2. Operator Precedence:**
```sql
-- Without parentheses (AND has higher precedence)
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category_id = 1 OR category_id = 2 AND price > 50;
-- Equivalent to: category_id = 1 OR (category_id = 2 AND price > 50)

-- With parentheses (clearer intent)
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE (category_id = 1 OR category_id = 2) AND price > 50;
```

### Real-World WHERE Examples

**1. E-commerce Product Search:**
```sql
-- Find available products in specific categories with good ratings
SELECT product_id, product_name, price, average_rating
FROM products 
WHERE category_id IN (1, 3, 5)           -- Electronics, Books, Clothing
  AND stock_quantity > 0                  -- In stock
  AND price BETWEEN 10 AND 500           -- Price range
  AND average_rating >= 4.0              -- Good ratings
  AND status = 'active'                  -- Active products
  AND (discount_percentage > 0 OR is_featured = true); -- On sale or featured
```

**2. Customer Segmentation:**
```sql
-- Find high-value customers for marketing campaign
SELECT customer_id, email, first_name, last_name, total_spent
FROM customers 
WHERE total_spent > 1000                 -- High spenders
  AND last_order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'  -- Recent activity
  AND email_verified = true              -- Verified email
  AND marketing_consent = true           -- Opted in for marketing
  AND status = 'active'                  -- Active account
  AND country IN ('US', 'CA', 'UK');     -- Specific regions
```

**3. Order Analysis:**
```sql
-- Find problematic orders that need attention
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount, status
FROM orders 
WHERE (
    -- Old pending orders
    (status = 'pending' AND order_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days')
    OR 
    -- High-value failed orders
    (status = 'failed' AND total_amount > 500)
    OR 
    -- Shipped orders without tracking
    (status = 'shipped' AND tracking_number IS NULL)
  )
  AND order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'; -- Last 30 days only
```

---

## üìä GROUP BY Clause - Grouping Data

### Basic GROUP BY Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1;
```

### Simple Grouping

**1. Basic Grouping:**
```sql
-- Count customers by country
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY country;

-- Average order value by customer
SELECT customer_id, AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Total sales by product category
SELECT c.category_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_sales
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name;
```

**2. Multiple Column Grouping:**
```sql
-- Sales by category and month
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) as month,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as monthly_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY c.category_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date)
ORDER BY year, month, category_name;

-- Customer behavior by country and age group
SELECT 
    country,
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM age(date_of_birth)) < 25 THEN '18-24'
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM age(date_of_birth)) < 35 THEN '25-34'
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM age(date_of_birth)) < 45 THEN '35-44'
        WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM age(date_of_birth)) < 55 THEN '45-54'
        ELSE '55+'
    END as age_group,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    AVG(total_spent) as avg_spent
FROM customers
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country, age_group
ORDER BY country, age_group;
```

### Advanced Grouping

**1. Grouping with Expressions:**
```sql
-- Sales by quarter
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM order_date) as quarter,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_sales,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date), EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM order_date)
ORDER BY year, quarter;

-- Product performance by price range
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN price < 25 THEN 'Budget ($0-$24)'
        WHEN price < 100 THEN 'Mid-range ($25-$99)'
        WHEN price < 500 THEN 'Premium ($100-$499)'
        ELSE 'Luxury ($500+)'
    END as price_category,
    COUNT(*) as product_count,
    AVG(average_rating) as avg_rating,
    SUM(units_sold) as total_units_sold
FROM products
GROUP BY price_category
ORDER BY MIN(price);
```

**2. Grouping Sets (PostgreSQL):**
```sql
-- Multiple grouping levels in one query
SELECT 
    category_id,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) as year,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (category_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)),  -- By category and year
    (category_id),                                  -- By category only
    (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)),               -- By year only
    ()                                             -- Grand total
)
ORDER BY category_id, year;
```

**3. ROLLUP and CUBE (PostgreSQL):**
```sql
-- ROLLUP: Hierarchical subtotals
SELECT 
    country,
    state,
    city,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY ROLLUP(country, state, city)
ORDER BY country, state, city;

-- CUBE: All possible combinations
SELECT 
    category_id,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM order_date) as quarter,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY CUBE(category_id, year, quarter)
ORDER BY category_id, year, quarter;
```

---

## üéØ HAVING Clause - Filtering Groups

### Basic HAVING Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1
HAVING aggregate_condition;
```

### HAVING vs WHERE
- **WHERE**: Filters rows before grouping
- **HAVING**: Filters groups after aggregation

### HAVING Examples

**1. Basic HAVING:**
```sql
-- Customers with more than 5 orders
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- Categories with average product price > $50
SELECT category_id, AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category_id
HAVING AVG(price) > 50;

-- Countries with total sales > $10,000
SELECT 
    c.country,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) as customer_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.country
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 10000;
```

**2. Complex HAVING Conditions:**
```sql
-- High-value customer segments
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_spent,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3                    -- At least 3 orders
   AND SUM(total_amount) > 500          -- Spent more than $500
   AND AVG(total_amount) > 50;          -- Average order > $50

-- Product categories with consistent sales
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date)) as active_months,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_sales,
    STDDEV(monthly_sales.sales) as sales_variance
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        p2.category_id,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o2.order_date) as month,
        SUM(oi2.quantity * oi2.unit_price) as sales
    FROM products p2
    JOIN order_items oi2 ON p2.product_id = oi2.product_id
    JOIN orders o2 ON oi2.order_id = o2.order_id
    GROUP BY p2.category_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o2.order_date)
) monthly_sales ON c.category_id = monthly_sales.category_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date)) >= 6  -- Active in 6+ months
   AND STDDEV(monthly_sales.sales) < 1000;                    -- Low variance
```

**3. HAVING with Subqueries:**
```sql
-- Categories performing above average
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as category_sales
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
HAVING SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) > (
    SELECT AVG(category_total)
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(oi2.quantity * oi2.unit_price) as category_total
        FROM categories c2
        JOIN products p2 ON c2.category_id = p2.category_id
        JOIN order_items oi2 ON p2.product_id = oi2.product_id
        GROUP BY c2.category_id
    ) avg_calc
);
```

---

## üìà ORDER BY Clause - Sorting Results

### Basic ORDER BY Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY columns
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];
```

### Sorting Options

**1. Basic Sorting:**
```sql
-- Single column sorting
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price;           -- Ascending (default)
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price ASC;      -- Explicit ascending
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;     -- Descending

-- Multiple column sorting
SELECT * FROM customers 
ORDER BY country ASC, last_name ASC, first_name ASC;

-- Mixed sorting directions
SELECT product_name, price, average_rating
FROM products 
ORDER BY average_rating DESC, price ASC;
```

**2. Sorting by Expressions:**
```sql
-- Sort by calculated values
SELECT 
    product_name,
    price,
    stock_quantity,
    (price * stock_quantity) as inventory_value
FROM products 
ORDER BY (price * stock_quantity) DESC;

-- Sort by string functions
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM customers 
ORDER BY LENGTH(email) DESC, email ASC;

-- Sort by date parts
SELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount
FROM orders 
ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date), EXTRACT(DAY FROM order_date);
```

**3. Conditional Sorting:**
```sql
-- Custom sort order with CASE
SELECT order_id, status, order_date
FROM orders 
ORDER BY 
    CASE status
        WHEN 'urgent' THEN 1
        WHEN 'processing' THEN 2
        WHEN 'pending' THEN 3
        WHEN 'shipped' THEN 4
        WHEN 'delivered' THEN 5
        ELSE 6
    END,
    order_date DESC;

-- Sort products by availability, then by rating
SELECT product_name, stock_quantity, average_rating
FROM products 
ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN stock_quantity > 0 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,  -- In stock first
    average_rating DESC,
    product_name ASC;
```

**4. NULL Handling in Sorting:**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Control NULL position
SELECT customer_id, phone
FROM customers 
ORDER BY phone NULLS LAST;   -- NULLs at the end

SELECT customer_id, phone
FROM customers 
ORDER BY phone NULLS FIRST;  -- NULLs at the beginning

-- MySQL: Use ISNULL() or COALESCE()
SELECT customer_id, phone
FROM customers 
ORDER BY ISNULL(phone), phone;  -- NULLs first

SELECT customer_id, phone
FROM customers 
ORDER BY COALESCE(phone, 'ZZZZZ');  -- Treat NULL as 'ZZZZZ'
```

### Advanced Sorting

**1. Sorting Aggregated Results:**
```sql
-- Top customers by total spending
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC NULLS LAST, order_count DESC;

-- Best selling products by category
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as total_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_revenue
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name, p.product_id, p.product_name
ORDER BY c.category_name, total_revenue DESC;
```

**2. Window Function Sorting:**
```sql
-- Rank products within each category by sales
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as revenue,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY c.category_id 
        ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) DESC
    ) as category_rank
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name, p.product_id, p.product_name
ORDER BY c.category_name, category_rank;
```

---

## üîÑ Combining All Clauses

### Complete Query Structure
```sql
SELECT 
    -- What to show
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_id) as product_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as total_units_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.unit_price) as avg_unit_price,
    MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date
FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE 
    -- Filter individual rows
    o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'  -- Last year only
    AND o.status IN ('completed', 'shipped', 'delivered')  -- Successful orders
    AND p.status = 'active'                           -- Active products
GROUP BY 
    -- Group by category
    c.category_id, c.category_name
HAVING 
    -- Filter groups
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) >= 10                  -- At least 10 orders
    AND SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) > 1000      -- Revenue > $1000
ORDER BY 
    -- Sort results
    total_revenue DESC,                               -- Highest revenue first
    product_count DESC;                               -- Then by product count
```

### Real-World Complex Examples

**1. Sales Performance Dashboard:**
```sql
-- Monthly sales performance with growth metrics
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) as month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    SUM(CASE WHEN c.created_at >= o.order_date - INTERVAL '30 days' 
             THEN o.total_amount ELSE 0 END) as new_customer_revenue,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN o.total_amount > 100 THEN 1 END) as high_value_orders
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years'
    AND o.status IN ('completed', 'shipped', 'delivered')
    AND o.total_amount > 0
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date),
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date)
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) >= 5  -- Months with at least 5 orders
ORDER BY 
    year DESC, month DESC;
```

**2. Customer Segmentation Analysis:**
```sql
-- RFM Analysis: Recency, Frequency, Monetary
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    -- Recency: Days since last order
    CURRENT_DATE - MAX(order_date) as days_since_last_order,
    
    -- Frequency: Number of orders
    COUNT(*) as order_frequency,
    
    -- Monetary: Total spent
    SUM(total_amount) as total_monetary_value,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value,
    
    -- Customer segment based on behavior
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) >= 10 AND SUM(total_amount) >= 1000 
             AND CURRENT_DATE - MAX(order_date) <= 30 
        THEN 'VIP'
        
        WHEN COUNT(*) >= 5 AND SUM(total_amount) >= 500 
             AND CURRENT_DATE - MAX(order_date) <= 90 
        THEN 'Loyal'
        
        WHEN COUNT(*) >= 3 AND CURRENT_DATE - MAX(order_date) <= 180 
        THEN 'Regular'
        
        WHEN CURRENT_DATE - MAX(order_date) <= 365 
        THEN 'Occasional'
        
        ELSE 'Inactive'
    END as customer_segment
FROM orders
WHERE 
    order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years'
    AND status IN ('completed', 'delivered')
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) >= 1  -- At least one order
ORDER BY 
    total_monetary_value DESC,
    order_frequency DESC,
    days_since_last_order ASC;
```

**3. Product Performance Analysis:**
```sql
-- Product performance with seasonal trends
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    c.category_name,
    
    -- Overall metrics
    COUNT(DISTINCT oi.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as total_units_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.unit_price) as avg_selling_price,
    
    -- Seasonal performance
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o.order_date) = 1 
             THEN oi.quantity ELSE 0 END) as q1_units,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o.order_date) = 2 
             THEN oi.quantity ELSE 0 END) as q2_units,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM o.order_date) = 3

## üéØ Use Cases & Interview Tips

### Common Interview Questions:

1. **"What's the difference between WHERE and HAVING?"**
   - WHERE filters rows before grouping
   - HAVING filters groups after aggregation
   - WHERE cannot use aggregate functions, HAVING can
   - WHERE is processed before GROUP BY, HAVING after

2. **"Explain the SQL execution order"**
   - FROM ‚Üí WHERE ‚Üí GROUP BY ‚Üí HAVING ‚Üí SELECT ‚Üí ORDER BY ‚Üí LIMIT
   - Understanding this helps write correct queries and debug issues

3. **"How do you optimize queries with these clauses?"**
   - Use indexes on WHERE clause columns
   - Use indexes on GROUP BY columns
   - Use indexes on ORDER BY columns
   - Filter early with WHERE to reduce data for grouping
   - Use LIMIT when you don't need all results

### Performance Best Practices:

1. **Index Strategy:**
   ```sql
   -- Create composite indexes for common query patterns
   CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price ON products(category_id, price);
   CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_date ON orders(status, order_date);
   ```

2. **Query Optimization:**
   ```sql
   -- Good: Filter early with WHERE
   SELECT category_id, COUNT(*)
   FROM products 
   WHERE status = 'active'  -- Filter first
   GROUP BY category_id;
   
   -- Avoid: Filtering after grouping when possible
   SELECT category_id, COUNT(*)
   FROM products 
   GROUP BY category_id
   HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0;
   ```

3. **Efficient Aggregation:**
   ```sql
   -- Use specific aggregate functions
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;              -- Count all rows
   SELECT COUNT(customer_id) FROM orders;    -- Count non-NULL values
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM orders;  -- Count unique values
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Watch Out For

### 1. **GROUP BY Rules**
```sql
-- Error: Non-aggregated column in SELECT without GROUP BY
SELECT customer_id, order_date, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;  -- order_date not in GROUP BY!

-- Correct: Include all non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY
SELECT customer_id, order_date, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, order_date;

-- Or use aggregation for the column
SELECT customer_id, MAX(order_date) as latest_order, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 2. **NULL Handling in Aggregates**
```sql
-- COUNT(*) counts all rows, COUNT(column) ignores NULLs
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,           -- All customers
    COUNT(phone) as customers_with_phone,  -- Only non-NULL phones
    COUNT(DISTINCT country) as unique_countries
FROM customers;

-- SUM, AVG ignore NULLs
SELECT 
    AVG(rating) as avg_rating,                    -- Ignores NULL ratings
    AVG(COALESCE(rating, 0)) as avg_rating_with_zero  -- Treats NULL as 0
FROM product_reviews;
```

### 3. **Date/Time Grouping Pitfalls**
```sql
-- Problem: Grouping by full timestamp
SELECT order_date, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date;  -- Groups by exact timestamp!

-- Solution: Extract date part
SELECT DATE(order_date) as order_day, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY DATE(order_date);

-- Or use date truncation (PostgreSQL)
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date) as order_day, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date);
```

### 4. **Performance Issues**
```sql
-- Slow: No indexes on filtered/grouped columns
SELECT category_id, COUNT(*)
FROM products 
WHERE price > 100
GROUP BY category_id
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Fast: With proper indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price_category ON products(price, category_id);
```

### 5. **Logical Operator Precedence**
```sql
-- Confusing: AND has higher precedence than OR
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE category_id = 1 OR category_id = 2 AND price > 50;
-- Equivalent to: category_id = 1 OR (category_id = 2 AND price > 50)

-- Clear: Use parentheses
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE (category_id = 1 OR category_id = 2) AND price > 50;
```

## üìù Quick Practice

Try these exercises with a sample e-commerce database:

1. **Basic Filtering**: Find all orders from the last 30 days with a total amount greater than $100
2. **Grouping**: Calculate total sales by month for the current year
3. **Having**: Find customers who have placed more than 3 orders and spent more than $500 total
4. **Complex Query**: Create a report showing the top 5 product categories by revenue, including the number of products and average price per category
5. **Performance**: Identify which indexes would improve the performance of your queries

Consider:
- How do you handle NULL values in your calculations?
- What happens when you group by date columns?
- How do you ensure your queries are efficient?
- What business insights can you derive from the grouped data?
